This folder holds local copies of data. The main file you need to add here is `Speed Dating Data.csv` from [http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/speed.dating](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/speed.dating). The Jupyter notebook will create a preprocessed version of the CSV to fix up a character encoding issue and will store that copy in this directory for the remainder of the analysis.
